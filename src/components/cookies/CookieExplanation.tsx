          To improve user experience Timeling uses cookies. A cookie is a small
          file that is stored on your device (PC, tablet or smartphone) when you
          browse a website. A cookie cannot contain a virus or damage your
          devices. According to their origin, cookies may be from ourselves or
          third parties (another domain deposits them, with our authorisation).
          We will tell you below about which cookies we use, how to exercise
          your rights and how to configure your cookie preferences.

        <h2>Which cookies do we use?</h2>
        <p>
          While you browse timeling.com, or during your relationship with us as
          a member, you may be exposed to different types of cookies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cookies that allow us to obtain a statistical analysis on the number
            of visits that each section of timeling.com receives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cookies to show more information on certain matters. Some of these
            elements are not stored timeling.com, but rather on a third-party
            site. Even though we try to prevent these third parties from
            depositing a cookie on your device, it is very difficult for us to
            control this outside content.

        <h2>Your rights on cookies</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether a website can deposit cookies on
          your device. One of the options you have to do so is to configure your
          browser appropriately, for example, indicating that you do not want to
          receive any cookies from any site.
          <p>
            You can also delete them or change your cookie preferences by
            following the instructions provided to that end for the most-used
            browsers:

            If you want to have more control, you can install programs or
            browser extensions, known as "Do Not Track", which will allow you to
            select which cookies you accept and which you don't. To that end, we
            recommend that you use services specialised in privacy such as
            ghostery.com or aboutcookies.org
